# AStar
A visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm

## Usage

### Running

**Java must be installed!**

If using shell, change directory to folder with AStar.jar and config.properties file

```sh
cd path/to/AStar/run
java -jar AStar.jar
```

OR

If using Jar launcher, just open the AStar.jar by double clicking

### Settings

To change settings, you can safely modify the config file (either  the [root](/config.properties) or the [run](/run/config.properties) file) but **do not change the property names** and config file must be kept in the same folder as the AStar.jar file

### Other

##### Notes:

If running with Eclipse, modify root config file.

If running JAR, modify config in run folder.
