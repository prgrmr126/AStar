# AStar
A visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm

## Usage

### Running

**Java must be installed!**

If using shell, change directory to folder with AStar.jar and config.properties files

```sh
cd path/to/folder
java -jar AStar.jar
```

OR

If using Jar launcher, just open the AStar.jar by double clicking

### Settings

To change settings, you can safely modify the [config](/config.properties) file but **do not change the variable names** and config file must be kept in the same folder as the AStar.jar file
